# Bob-Life: DingleBob Inc

This project, Bob Life, is an _Incubation_ project from CSCI 3312. Our project is similar to __Duck Life__ where the player is able to train their character's stats throughout the game through small minigames.

## Summary of the Game: 
Bob (672 years) falls in love with Bobette but Bobette finds Brutus the Barber Beefcake. He trains himself in multiple categories and challenges Brutus the Barber Beefcake to a showdown. After winning, Bob wins Bobette's affection and marries her in the end cutscene. If players max out all stats, they can marry Brutus.

## Summary of the gameplay aesthetics/dynamics: 
- Sprites will change based on the change of Bob’s stats, sprites becomes more buff and closer to Bobette’s “ideal”

## Relationship between aesthetics and mechanics
- Minigames gets progressively more different the longer you play it (ex: actions go by faster or rhythm of music speeds up)
- Time at the top right corner that keeps track of how long it takes to play the game, encourages speedrunning. 

## Vision for art/sound direction
- 16 bit art style with generally bright colors 
- Animal crossing music for general main menu screen 
- Minigame music with more upbeat pop music 
- Final Game music that sounds like Mario Star Theme

## Unique selling points: 
- Interactive with growing the player
- Easy to play
- Speedrunning/Replayability

##Why my game is interesting or different: 
- Trying to get with the Girl or Brutus the Barber Beefcake
- Bob’s ability and sprites change based on what stats are leveled up

## Competitive products and similar games
- Duck Life 1, 2, 3, and 4; Sonic battle 2 Chaos races
